    "    - Compare the results with the built-in scipy function `scipy.interpolate.lagrange`;\n",
    "    - Extrapolation: if we only use data in the time window $[0, 3100]$, how does the interpolation performs at $t=3300$?\n",

    "## Assignment 2: Predict Airbnb Prices with Linear Regression From Scratch\n",

    "\n",
    "Recovering the original image from a blurred observation is an important problem in image processing and scientific computing. This task allows you to explore linear systems, both direct and iterative solvers. In this exercise, you will model the image deblurring problem as a linear system $Ku=f$, where $K$ represents the blur operator, $f$ is the observed blurred (and possibly noisy) image, and $u$ is the unknown sharp image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dataset and Blur Simulation: Load a standard grayscale image (e.g., `skimage.data.camera()`). Apply a simple convolutional blur (e.g., 3×3 or 5×5 Gaussian-like kernel, see code below).\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Hint*: use functions `skimage.img_as_float` to read the image, and `scipy.signal.convolve2d` to apply the blurring kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Linear System Formulation: Represent the blurring operation as a linear system $Ku=f$, where $f$ is the blurred image, and $u$ is the original image we want to reconstruct by solving the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Hints*:\n",
    "       - Compute each column $j$-th of matrix $K$ by applying the `convolve2d` operation on a basis vector (which has component $1$ only at column $j$ and $0$ everywhere else).\n",
    "       - To be precise, $f$ and $u$ are the *vectorized* images (if the image has shape $(N, N)$, the vectorized image has shape $(N^2, 1)$).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Direct Solver: Solve the linear system using a direct solver ($LU$ factorization).\n",
    " \n",
    "   *Hint*: consider applying methods for sparse matrices (built-in `scipy` methods).\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Iterative Solvers: Implement and test Jacobi and Gauss–Seidel iterative methods.\n",
    "Optionally, use Conjugate Gradient ($CG$) if the system is symmetric and positive definite.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Compare the methods in terms of convergence rates and number of iterations: plot the residual vs iterations, and print the accuracy of the obtained images in terms of the mean squared error with respect to the original one.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. **Bonus**: repeat the same analysis adding also a Gaussian noise to the blurred image $f$. How do the methods perform now?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestion**: always solve the problems depending on the computational power of your laptop. The image might be too big: for example `skimage.data.camera()` produces an image of size $(512, 512)$, and the matrix $K$ would have size $(512^2, 512^2)$. Consider downsampling it, for example considering an image of size $(64, 64)$ or $(32, 32)$."
